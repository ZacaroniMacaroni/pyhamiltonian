# pyhamiltonian
N-particle Hamiltonian constructor in d-dimensional lattice space.

# Purpose
Generating Hamiltonians for N-particles while correctly accounting for couplings, many-body interactions, and dimensionality is difficult to generalize _a priori_. This constructor is intended to facilitate Hamiltonian construction for arbitrary lattice dimension, number of particles, and particle interactions via a straightforward UI. (We will restrict ourselves to the bosonic case for this implementation.)
